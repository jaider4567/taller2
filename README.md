# Workshop II - Swarm Intelligence and Synergy: Ant Colony for the Traveling Salesman Problem

## Workshop Definition:
In this second workshop, the goal is to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. It's time to apply a very popular swarm intelligence algorithm to a real-world problem.

Imagine you've been hired as an artificial intelligence engineer at an important logistics company. Your boss, the Chief Technology Officer, wants to find the shortest path to deliver some products. After analyzing the problem, you realize it's similar to the TSP, and you remember that you know some swarm intelligence algorithms useful for solving this problem, one of which is ACO.

## Introduction:
This repository contains the implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). ACO is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. 

## Usage:
To use this implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the main script providing necessary inputs such as the number of cities, distances between cities, and other parameters.
4. Analyze the output to find the shortest path.

## Installation:
To install the dependencies, use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
