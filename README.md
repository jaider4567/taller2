Workshop II - Swarm Inelligence and Sinergy: Ant Colony for the Traveler Salesman Problem
Workshop Definition:
In this second workshop, the idea is you solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. It is time to apply a very popular swarm intelligence algorithm to a problem in the real world.

Imagine you have been hired as artificial intelligence engineer in an important logistic company. Your boss, a Chief Technology Officer, wants to get shortest path to deliver some products. You analyze the problem, and figure out it is similar to TSP, and you remember you know some swarm intellinge algoritms useful to solve this problem, in this case, ACO.

Here you will have some tasks in order to complete this workshop:

Generate several random 
 space points in order to define cities to be visited by the salesman.
With random points, generate a list in order to define the requirements for the route.
Implement ACO in order to solve TSP problem. Test different parameters combination.
Draw a 
 plot in order to see the output of the algorithm.
Think some conclusions based on outputs analysis.
Write any technical concern/decision/difficulty you think is relevant regarding your work. You must deliver a full report detailing each one of the previous steps. I strongly recommend you to use a Jupyter Notebook or a COLAB to write/execute your code. Also, your work must include the report, the code, and a README.md file in repo of the course, everything in a folder called workshop_2.
